# Overleaf Skill

Manage Overleaf LaTeX projects via the `olcli` CLI, native git remote, or MCP server.

## When to Use Which Mode

| Mode | Best for | How |
|------|----------|-----|
| **CLI** (`olcli`) | Interactive workflows, sync, compile, arXiv prep | `olcli pull/push/sync/pdf` |
| **Git remote** | Version control, commits, diffs, CI/CD pipelines | `git clone overleaf::…` then standard git |
| **MCP server** | AI agents with MCP support (Claude, Cursor, Windsurf) | Connect via `olcli-mcp` stdio transport |

Use **CLI** when you need bidirectional sync with conflict detection, compilation, or comment management. Use **Git remote** when you want proper git history, branches, and standard `git push/pull`. Use **MCP** when an AI agent has native MCP support and doesn't need to shell out.

## Installation

```bash
# Homebrew (recommended)
brew tap aloth/tap && brew install olcli

# npm
npm install -g @aloth/olcli
```

## Authentication

Get your session cookie from Overleaf:

1. Log into [overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com)
2. Open DevTools (F12) → Application → Cookies
3. Copy the value of `overleaf_session2`

```bash
olcli auth --cookie "YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE"
```

Verify with:
```bash
olcli whoami
```

Debug authentication issues:
```bash
olcli check
```

Clear stored credentials:
```bash
olcli logout
```

Clears the global config and the `.olauth` file in the current directory, and
reports each. Environment variables cannot be unset by a child process, so
`OVERLEAF_SESSION` and `OVERLEAF_EMAIL`/`OVERLEAF_PASSWORD` are reported rather
than silently ignored — they outrank anything on disk.

For unattended use, prefer `OVERLEAF_EMAIL`/`OVERLEAF_PASSWORD` over
`olcli auth --password`: every command reads them, and nothing is written to
disk or to shell history.

### Self-hosted Overleaf

```bash
olcli config set-url https://overleaf.yourcompany.com
olcli config set-cookie-name overleaf.sid   # if different from default
olcli auth --cookie "YOUR_COOKIE"
```

Or pass per-command: `olcli --base-url https://overleaf.yourcompany.com list`

## Git Remote Helper

Use Overleaf projects as native git remotes. No wrapper scripts needed.

```bash
# Clone
git clone overleaf::https://www.overleaf.com/project/<id>
cd <project>

# Edit, commit, push — standard git workflow
vim main.tex
git add . && git commit -m "update introduction"
git push

# Pull latest from Overleaf
git pull
```

Authentication: reads `OVERLEAF_SESSION` env var, `~/.olauth` file, or stored config (same as CLI).

For self-hosted instances, just use your instance URL:
```bash
git clone overleaf::https://overleaf.yourcompany.com/project/<id>
```

Debug with: `GIT_REMOTE_OVERLEAF_DEBUG=1 git push`

## MCP Server

Built-in Model Context Protocol server for AI assistant integration.

```bash
# Run standalone
olcli-mcp

# Or via npx
npx @aloth/olcli-mcp
```

Available MCP tools: `list_projects`, `get_project_info`, `pull_project`, `push_file`, `compile`, `download_pdf`, `list_comments`, `get_entities`, `download_file`, `add_comment`, `reply_to_comment`, `resolve_comment`, `delete_entity`, `rename_entity`, `rename_project`, `plan_project_renames`, `compile_with_outputs`, `diff_project`, `create_project`.

`compile`, `download_pdf` and `compile_with_outputs` accept an optional `resource_path` to compile a specific root document.

`diff_project` is the MCP counterpart of `olcli diff`: read-only, fetches the remote fresh on every call, and returns one entry per changed file with `path`, `status`, `binary` and a unified `patch`. Pass `name_only` to drop the patch text. `plan_project_renames` previews bulk renames and never applies them.

Auth: set `OVERLEAF_SESSION` env var in MCP config, or use stored credentials from `olcli auth`.

## Common Workflows

### Pull a project to work locally

```bash
olcli pull "My Paper"
cd My_Paper/
```

### Create a project

```bash
olcli project create "My Paper"
olcli project create "Example Paper" --template example
```

### Edit and sync changes

```bash
# After editing files locally
olcli push              # Upload changes only
olcli sync              # Bidirectional sync (pull + push, propagates local deletions)
olcli sync --no-delete  # Sync without propagating local deletions to remote
```

### Review changes before pushing

```bash
olcli diff                 # unified diff of every changed file
olcli diff --name-only     # changed paths only
olcli diff --file main.tex # a single file
olcli diff --exit-code     # CI gate: 0 same, 1 differs, 2 failed
```

The remote side is fetched fresh each run, so this shows what a subsequent
`push` would overwrite — not a comparison against the last `pull`. `a/` is the
remote, `b/` is local. Binary files are reported as differing without a patch.

`--exit-code` uses `diff(1)`'s statuses so the command can gate a pipeline:
`0` nothing differs, `1` something does, `2` the run itself failed. The last
one matters — without it a job cannot tell a changed file from an expired
session. Failures stay `1` when the flag is absent, so existing scripts are
unaffected.

### Delete or rename remote files

```bash
olcli delete chapters/old.tex          # remove a file from the project
olcli rm figures/old.pdf               # alias
olcli rename old.tex new.tex           # rename a file
olcli mv chapters/draft.tex chapters/intro.tex   # alias
```

### Inspect ignore rules

```bash
olcli ignored              # list active patterns (built-ins + .olignore + .olignore.local)
olcli push --show-ignored  # see what was filtered on this run
olcli sync --no-ignore     # escape hatch: upload everything
```

### Compile and download PDF

```bash
olcli pdf                      # Compile and download
olcli pdf -o paper.pdf         # Custom output name
olcli pdf -r chapters/intro.tex  # Compile a specific root document
olcli compile                  # Just compile (no download)
olcli compile -r appendix.tex  # Compile a specific root document without downloading
```

`-r, --resource <path>` works on `compile`, `pdf`, and `output`: it compiles the given `.tex` file as the root document. Useful when a project contains several documents.  

### Download .bbl for arXiv submission

```bash
olcli output bbl               # Download compiled .bbl
olcli output bbl -o main.bbl   # Custom filename
olcli output bbl -r appendix.tex
olcli output --list            # List all available outputs
```

### Upload figures or assets

```bash
olcli upload figure1.png "My Paper"          # Upload to project root
olcli upload diagram.pdf                      # Auto-detect project from .olcli.json
olcli upload figures/diagram.png              # Relative path is preserved remotely
olcli upload /tmp/build/diagram.png           # Absolute path lands in the project root
olcli upload /tmp/build/diagram.png --to figures/diagram.png   # Explicit destination
```

Remote path rules: a relative local path keeps its directory part, an absolute
local path collapses to its basename, and `--to` overrides both.

### Download specific files

```bash
olcli download main.tex "My Paper"           # Download single file
olcli zip "My Paper"                          # Download entire project as zip
```

### Review comments

```bash
olcli comments list                          # List all comments (current project)
olcli comments list --status open            # Filter by status (open/resolved/all)
olcli comments list --context                # Include surrounding text
olcli comments add main.tex "Fix this citation" --from 10 --to 15  # Add comment
olcli comments reply <thread-id> "Done!"     # Reply to thread
olcli comments resolve <thread-id>           # Mark as resolved
olcli comments reopen <thread-id>            # Reopen a resolved thread
olcli comments delete <thread-id>            # Delete entire thread
```

## arXiv Submission Workflow

Complete workflow for preparing an arXiv submission:

```bash
# 1. Pull your project
olcli pull "Research Paper"
cd Research_Paper

# 2. Compile to ensure everything builds
olcli compile

# 3. Download the .bbl file (arXiv requires .bbl, not .bib)
olcli output bbl -o main.bbl

# 4. Download any other needed outputs
olcli output aux -o main.aux    # If needed

# 5. Package for submission
zip arxiv.zip *.tex main.bbl figures/*.pdf

# 6. Verify the package compiles locally (optional)
# Then upload arxiv.zip to arxiv.org
```

## Tips

- **Auto-detect project**: Run commands from a synced directory (contains `.olcli.json`) to skip the project argument
- **Dry run**: Use `olcli push --dry-run` or `olcli sync --dry-run` to preview before applying
- **Preview content**: `push --dry-run` lists files by modification time; `olcli diff` compares actual contents, so the two lists can differ
- **CI gate**: `olcli diff --exit-code` exits 1 when anything differs and 2 when the run failed, so a pipeline can distinguish drift from breakage
- **Force overwrite**: Use `olcli pull --force` to overwrite local changes
- **Two-way deletes**: `olcli sync` propagates *local* deletions to the remote; use `--no-delete` to opt out per run
- **Build artifacts**: `.aux`, `.bbl`, `.log`, `.synctex.gz` etc. are filtered by default. Add custom patterns to a `.olignore` file (gitignore-style)
- **PDF rule**: `thesis.pdf` next to `thesis.tex` is auto-ignored; standalone `figures/diagram.pdf` is preserved
- **Project ID**: You can use project ID instead of name (24-char hex from URL)
- **Debug auth**: Run `olcli check` to see where credentials are loaded from
- **Timeout**: `olcli --timeout 60000 pull "Big Project"` or `olcli config set-timeout 60000`
