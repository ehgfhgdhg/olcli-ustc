## Installation

### One-line installer (recommended)

Installs from the USTC-hosted tarball and authenticates automatically:

```bash
curl -sSL https://latex.ustc.edu.cn/agent/install.sh -o install.sh
bash install.sh --token YOUR_TOKEN
```

Get your token by visiting `https://latex.ustc.edu.cn/agent/setup` in your browser.

olcli is installed to `~/.local/olcli-ustc/bin/`. If `olcli` is not found after install, run `source ~/.bashrc` or `export PATH="$HOME/.local/olcli-ustc/bin:$PATH"`.

### Manual installation

```bash
npm install -g https://latex.ustc.edu.cn/agent/olcli-ustc-latest.tgz
olcli config set-url https://latex.ustc.edu.cn
olcli config set-cookie-name overleaf.sid
```

### For AI agents

Fetch the skill file from the agent service:

```
https://latex.ustc.edu.cn/agent/SKILL.md
```

The skill file contains instructions for the agent to guide the user through the token-based auth flow.

## Quick Start

### 1. Authenticate

**One-time token** (recommended for headless servers):

1. Visit `https://latex.ustc.edu.cn/agent/setup` in your browser
2. Copy the install command
3. Run on your server:

```bash
curl -sSL https://latex.ustc.edu.cn/agent/install.sh | bash -s -- --token YOUR_TOKEN
```

Or just the token:

```bash
olcli auth --token "YOUR_TOKEN"
```

**Session cookie** (manual):

```bash
olcli auth --cookie "your_session_cookie_value"
```

**Email/password** (non-CAS instances only):

```bash
olcli auth --email "you@example.com"
# prompts for the password, so it stays out of your shell history
```

The password is **not stored** unless you pass `--save-password`. A session
cookie is saved either way and is what later commands use; the password only
buys an automatic re-login once that cookie expires. For scripts, set
`OVERLEAF_EMAIL` and `OVERLEAF_PASSWORD` — every command reads them, so a
scripted run never needs `olcli auth` at all.

### 2. List Projects

```bash
olcli list
```

### 3. Pull, Edit, Push

```bash
olcli pull "My Thesis"
cd My_Thesis/
vim main.tex
olcli push
```

### 4. Compile PDF

```bash
olcli pdf
# Compile a specific .tex file (for multi-doc projects):
olcli pdf -r appendix.tex
```

### 5. Or use native git commands

```bash
git clone overleaf::https://www.overleaf.com/project/<id>
cd <project>
# edit, commit, push — standard git workflow
git push
```

See [Git Remote Helper docs](docs/GIT-REMOTE.md) for details.

### Compile Options

The compile-related commands (`compile`, `pdf`, `output`) accept:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-r, --resource <path>` | Compile a specific `.tex` file as the root document (e.g. `appendix.tex`, `folder/test.tex`) |

Useful in multi-doc projects: each `-r` run compiles the file as if it were the main document.

### Global Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--verbose` | Print HTTP requests and responses to stderr |
| `--base-url <url>` | Override Overleaf instance URL |
| `--cookie-name <name>` | Override session cookie name |
| `--timeout <ms>` | Override HTTP timeout (default: 10000) |

## Sync Behavior

### Pull
- Downloads all files from Overleaf
- Skips local files modified after last pull (won't overwrite your changes)
- Use `--force` to overwrite local changes

### Push
- Uploads files modified after last pull
- Preserves nested folder structure
- Filters out LaTeX build artifacts and OS noise
- Use `--all` to upload all files, `--dry-run` to preview

### Sync
- Pulls remote changes, then pushes local changes
- Local modifications win if newer
- **Propagates local deletions** — use `--no-delete` to opt out
- Use `--dry-run` to preview without applying

### Diff

`olcli diff` compares the bytes of your local files against the project's
current contents and prints a unified diff.

```bash
olcli diff                 # every changed file, as patches
olcli diff --name-only     # just the changed paths
olcli diff --file main.tex # one file
olcli diff -U 8            # wider context
olcli diff --exit-code     # exit 1 if anything differs, for CI
```

**The remote side is fetched fresh on every run.** The diff describes the
project as it is at that moment — which is what a subsequent `push` would
overwrite — not a comparison against your last `pull`. `.olcli.json` records
remote *paths*, never remote *contents*, so there is no stored snapshot to
compare against; and the whole project arrives in a single request, the same
one `pull` makes, so fetching fresh costs one round trip rather than one per
file. A collaborator editing between `diff` and `push` can still change the
outcome, which is why the fetch time is printed.

In the output, `a/` is the remote and `b/` is local: a `+` line is content
`push` would upload, a `-` line is content it would overwrite. Files that
differ only in bytes that are not text (PDFs, images) are reported as
`Binary files ... differ`. Both sides pass through the same ignore layers, so
build artifacts sitting on Overleaf are not reported as locally deleted.

`diff --name-only` and `push --dry-run` answer different questions and will
disagree. `push --dry-run` lists files whose **modification time** is newer
than the last pull, because that is what `push` uploads; `diff` lists files
whose **contents** actually differ. A file you touched without editing appears
in the first and not the second.

#### Marked-up revisions with latexdiff

A unified diff is the right artifact for a developer and the wrong one for a
thesis advisor. `--latexdiff` marks the same revision up inside the document
instead — deletions struck through, additions underlined — which is what
advisors and journals ask for.

```bash
olcli diff --latexdiff          # write .olcli-diff/main-diff.tex
olcli diff --latexdiff --pdf    # ...and compile it, download .olcli-diff/main-diff.pdf
```

Requires `latexdiff` on your PATH. It ships with TeX Live and MacTeX; nothing
else in `olcli diff` needs an external tool.

**`--pdf` compiles on Overleaf, so you do not need a local TeX installation.**
The compile endpoint can only build a file that is in the project, so the
marked-up document is uploaded as `olcli-latexdiff.tex` next to your root
document, compiled, downloaded, and then removed. The command says so before it
does it, refuses to overwrite a file of that name if one already exists, and
prints the exact `olcli rm` command if the cleanup itself fails.

`\input` and `\include` are inlined before comparing (`--no-flatten` to opt
out). Without that, a remote compile would resolve those against the files
sitting in the project — the old content — and quietly produce a PDF showing
every input file as unchanged.

Output goes to `.olcli-diff/`, which is dotted so that `push` and `sync` never
pick it up; `-o <path>` puts it elsewhere. The root document is the `.tex` file
declaring `\documentclass`; if several do, `--main <path>` picks one rather
than the command guessing. `--latexdiff-opt` passes anything else straight
through, e.g. `--latexdiff-opt --math-markup=0`.

One limit worth knowing: `--pdf` compiles against the project, not against your
working directory, so anything the markup needs must already be on Overleaf. A
`.sty` or `.cls` you added locally fails the compile — the compiler log is
written next to the marked-up source when that happens. A *figure* you added
locally does not fail it; Overleaf draws a placeholder box naming the missing
file and the rest of the PDF is fine.

#### Using `diff` as a CI gate

`--exit-code` turns the command into a check, with the statuses `diff(1)` uses:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `0` | Nothing differs |
| `1` | Something differs |
| `2` | The run failed — bad flags, no session, project unreachable |

```yaml
- name: Fail if the paper on Overleaf has drifted from the repo
  run: olcli diff --exit-code --name-only
  env:
    OVERLEAF_SESSION: ${{ secrets.OVERLEAF_SESSION }}
```

**The `1` versus `2` split is the point of the flag.** Without it a pipeline
cannot tell a changed file from an expired session cookie, and a job that goes
red for the second reason sends whoever reads the log hunting for a diff that
was never computed. Every other olcli command reports failure as `1`, and
`olcli diff` still does when `--exit-code` is absent, so adding the flag does
not change what existing scripts see.

The gate covers whatever was compared: `--file main.tex` narrows it to one
file, the way a `git diff --exit-code` pathspec does, and a `--file` that
matches nothing is `0` rather than an error. Under `--latexdiff` it still
reports on the project as a whole — a changed figure is a real difference even
though a marked-up root document cannot show it.

Note that this compares against Overleaf **now**, not against your last pull,
so the check is "has anyone drifted from what is committed here", which is what
makes it worth running on a schedule as well as on a push.

#### How deletion propagation works

`olcli` records a manifest of remote files in `.olcli.json`. On next sync:

- File missing locally + still on remote → deleted on Overleaf
- File new locally → uploaded
- File modified locally → uploaded (local wins)
- File only on remote → downloaded

First-time syncs skip the deletion phase (no prior manifest to compare).

## Ignoring Files

### Three layers

| Layer | Source | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Built-in | LaTeX intermediates, OS noise, build dirs. Always on. |
| 2 | `.olignore` | Project-level patterns (gitignore syntax). |
| 3 | `.olignore.local` | Machine-specific patterns. |

Later layers override earlier ones. Negation (`!important.aux`) is supported.

### Special PDF rule

`X.pdf` is ignored only if `X.tex` (or `.ltx`) exists in the same folder.

### Inspecting and overriding

```bash
olcli ignored                  # list patterns in effect
olcli push --show-ignored      # see what was skipped
olcli sync --no-default-ignore # only .olignore applies
olcli sync --no-ignore         # upload everything
```

## Configuration

Credentials are checked in order:

1. `OVERLEAF_SESSION` environment variable
2. `.olauth` file in current directory
3. Global config — run `olcli check` to see the exact path

The global config path is platform-dependent (`conf` resolves it), so it is not
hardcoded here: on macOS it lands under `~/Library/Preferences/`, on Linux under
`~/.config/`. `olcli auth` prints the path it wrote to.

⚠️ `olcli auth --save-local` writes `.olauth` into the **current directory**,
which is usually your LaTeX project. Add it to that project's `.gitignore`
before committing.

### What is stored, and how to clear it

Everything is stored in plaintext, so it is worth knowing what is on disk:

| Credential | Stored by default | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Session cookie | yes | global config, or `.olauth` with `--save-local` |
| Email + password | **no** — only with `--save-password` | global config |

`olcli check` reports what exists without printing any secret.

`olcli logout` clears the global config **and** the `.olauth` file in the
current directory, then lists what it removed. It cannot unset environment
variables, so if `OVERLEAF_SESSION` or `OVERLEAF_EMAIL`/`OVERLEAF_PASSWORD` are
set, it says so instead of implying you are logged out — those take precedence
over anything on disk.

For headless servers, use `olcli auth --token` (see above).

### Self-hosted Overleaf

olcli defaults to `https://latex.ustc.edu.cn` with cookie name `overleaf.sid`.
For other instances:

```bash
olcli config set-url https://overleaf.yourcompany.com
olcli config set-cookie-name overleaf.sid
olcli auth --cookie "YOUR_COOKIE"
```

Or pass per-command: `olcli --base-url https://overleaf.yourcompany.com list`

### Timeout

```bash
olcli config set-timeout 60000          # persist
olcli --timeout 60000 pull "Big Thesis" # one-off
export OVERLEAF_TIMEOUT=60000           # env var
```

Precedence: `--timeout` > `OVERLEAF_TIMEOUT` > config > default (10000ms).

## Examples

```bash
# Daily thesis workflow
olcli pull "PhD Thesis" thesis && cd thesis
vim chapters/methods.tex
olcli sync && olcli pdf -o draft.pdf

# Quick PDF download
olcli pdf "Conference Paper" -o paper.pdf

# Compile a specific root document
olcli pdf "Conference Paper" -r appendix.tex -o appendix.pdf
olcli compile "Conference Paper" -r folder/test.tex

# Upload figures
olcli upload figures/diagram.png          # relative path is preserved
olcli upload /tmp/build/diagram.png       # absolute path lands in the project root
olcli upload /tmp/build/diagram.png --to figures/diagram.png   # explicit destination

# arXiv submission prep
olcli output bbl -o main.bbl
olcli output bbl -r folder/test.tex -o main.bbl  # compile artifacts from a specific root doc
olcli zip -o arxiv-submission.zip

# Backup all projects
for proj in $(olcli list --json | jq -r '.[].name'); do
  olcli zip "$proj" -o "backups/${proj}.zip"
done
```

## Troubleshooting

**Session expired** — Get a fresh cookie from the browser and run `olcli auth` again.

**Compilation fails** — Check the Overleaf web editor for detailed error logs (missing packages, syntax errors, missing bibliography files).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for local setup, which tests need a real
Overleaf account, and what to expect from CI on a pull request.

[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) explains how the client works —
there is no public Overleaf API, so it authenticates as a browser session.
